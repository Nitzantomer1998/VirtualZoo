<h1>Virtual Zoo</h1>
<p>
   The VirtualZoo repository contains the code and resources for an application that simulates a virtual zoo using the Java programming language.<br>
   This application is a student experiment that aims to learn and implement advanced knowledge in various programming concepts such as Object Oriented Programming
   (OOP), programming principles, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Threads and Design Patterns.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
   To build and run this project, you need to have the following tools installed
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Java SE Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above</li>
   <li>Intellij IDE</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<ol>
   <li>
      Clone or download the repository to your local machine
      <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/Nitzantomer1998/VirtualZoo.git</pre>
   </li>
   
   <li>
      Open the project in Intellij IDE
   </li>
   
   <li>
      Build and run the program
   </li>
   
   <li>
      From here you have the GUI panel for anything you need
   </li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to add animals and food to the virtual zoo
   </li>
   <li>
      Animals move and grow on their own, based on their eating habits
   </li>
   <li>
      Threads are used to simulate the movement of the animals
   </li>
   <li>
      The application demonstrates advanced knowledge in Java, OOP, programming principles, GUI, threads, and design patterns
   </li>
   <li>
      The code is well-organized and commented to make it easy to understand and follow
   </li>
   <li>
      The application have options to stop and continue the movement of the animals
   </li>
   <li>
      And a lot more
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      The application is limited in the number of animals that can be added and does not include all possible animal species
   </li>
   <li>
      Some functionality may be limited due to the scope of the project
   </li>
   <li>
      The movements and actions of the animals are based on randomness and does not reflect the behavior of the animals in the wild
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
   <li>
      Improve the Graphical User Interface
   </li>
   <li>
      Add more animal types
   </li>
   <li>
      Add the ability to remove animals from the virtual zoo
   </li>
   <li>
      Add more realistic features such as hunger, thirst, and sleep for the animals
   </li>
   <li>
      Add a feature where the user can interact with the animals, such as petting or feeding them
   </li>
   <li>
      Implement a weather system that affects the animals, such as raining or snowing
   </li>
   <li>
      Allow the user to customize the appearance of the animals and the virtual zoo environment
   </li>
   <li>
      Create a multiplayer feature where users can visit each other's virtual zoos and interact with the animals
   </li>
</ul>
